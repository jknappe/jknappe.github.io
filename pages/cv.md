I am an Environmental Scientist, currently working as doctoral researcher at Trinity College Dublin and the University of Limerick, Ireland. My work mainly deals with assessing the performance and environmental sustainability of on-site wastewater treatment installations. I holds an M.Sc. in Sustainable Development and worked for NGOs and initiatives in Africa, Asia, and Europe as researcher, consultant, and training content developer for adult learning. After more than 6 years of working in the water and sanitation sector, I am convinced that a combination of data-driven research, capacity building, and effective communication is the right enabling tool for achieving our global sustainable development goals.

#### Academic Experience
  
------------- | ---
<nobr>2014 to 2018</nobr>  | Doctoral Researcher in Environmental Engineering <br> **Trinity College Dublin & The University of Limerick, Ireland** <br> My work mainly focusses on evaluating domestic wastewater treatment systems. Based on field data, I am developing models to understand and predict the growth of soil biomass and its influence of overall treatment performance. Together with colleagues from TCD and UL, I am also involved in projects relating to quantifying greenhouse gas emissions from on-site systems using soil flux chambers, tracing the transformation of organic compounds in the subsoil using fluorometric methods, evaluating percolation tests procedures used for site assessment, measuring sludge accumulation rates in on-site systems, and evaluating the potential for heat recovery for domestic use from septic tanks.
<nobr>2010 to 2012</nobr>  | M.Sc. in Science for Sustainable Development <br> **Link&ouml;ping University, Sweden** <br> <i>Valedictorian</i> <br> Focus on sustainable sanitation and marine nutrient cycling
<nobr>2006 to 2010</nobr>  | B.Sc. in Biophysics <br> **G&ouml;ttingen University, Germany** <br> Focus on development of techniques for sub-second imiging of DNA compaction with atomic force microscopy
