### About Me

I am Jan - an environmental scientist with an undeniable fascination for data, sanitation, and fun facts. This website will keep you updated on my latest ramblings about the science, coding, and globetrotting I do.

Currently, I am a Doctoral Researcher at the [University of Limerick](https://www.ul.ie) and [Trinity College Dublin](https://www.tcd.ie) where I [study the influence of soil microbes on the movement of water and contaminant attenuation in soil treatment units receiving on-site effluent in Ireland](https://www.tcd.ie/civileng/people/doctoral-students/jan-knappe.php). I have a M.Sc. in Science for Sustainable Development from [Link&ouml;ping University (Sweden)](https://www.liu.se) and a B.Sc. in Biophysics from [Georg-August University G&ouml;ttingen (Germany)](https:/www.uni-goettingen.de). 

I do have a strong passion for teaching and training, especially in the sanitation sector. During my work with the German NGO [BORDA](http://en.borda.de/) in South Asia, the [International Humanitarian Innovation Academy](http://i-hia.com) in Africa, and Trinity's MOOC on '[Achieving Sustainable Development](https://www.futurelearn.com/courses/achieving-sustainable-development)', I learned that capacity building and the promotion of innovative solutions in the sector are excellent tools to achieving our global sanitation goals.
