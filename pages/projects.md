That's my little playground a.k.a. a personal to-do list.

# Android apps

I am currently working on building my own custom-made expense tracking app - Android app loading a web form that saves to Google sheet and visualizes using Shiny. Just for myself really. But I'll share the code once I got a working version up and running.

# Arduino Data Loggers

I built a few data loggers on Arduino basis in the past. The codes are up on Github, but I should share them soon here.

# R packages

Bundling useful functions into a separate package for R is super easy. Documenting and testing takes a bit more stamina, though. You can find all of the packages below on GitHub and help me making them better if you like.

## hydrus2r

Import HYDRUS 2D/3D simulation results into R using functions made available in this R package. Find more information on how to install and use the package on it's [GitHub page](https://www.janknappe.com/hydrus2r/).

## quantitray
