![Me in Kazakhstan](/images/pages/170712-CharynCanyon.jpg){:class="img-responsive"}

I am Jan - a traveling shit-stirrer (in the truest sense of the word) with an undeniable fascination for data, sanitation, and fun facts. This website will keep you updated on my latest ramblings about the science, coding, and some traveling I do.

I have been working in research and consulting since 2012 and co-authored a fair few papers and research reports on topic relating to sustainable water and wastewater management. If you're into this kind of stuff, you can find it on my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.de/citations?hl=de&user=b5iGQGMAAAAJ) profile.

Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:jan.knappe@tcd.ie), [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=JanKnappe), or connect on [LinkedIn](). I publish most of mny code on [GitHub](https://github.com/jknappe) - feel free to take a look and help me improve!

Some of my post on [R](/tags/#R) are featured on [R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com/), a great resource on everything R. So go and check them out as well!
