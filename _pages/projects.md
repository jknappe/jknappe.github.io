I am always working on a few data and real-world projects and I'm happy to share what I learn along the way.

# Scientific data logging

I have been involved in a multitude of scientific projects where we set up automated sensor networks for environmental monitoring and programmable logic controller systems. I usually share the code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/jknappe) and will write more detailed documentation in time. Here are a few of the notable ongoing projects:

- **ufz-weather-station** A collection of CRBasic scripts for Campbell Scientific CR1000X data loggers (including the compact ClimaVue50 weather station, soil sensors and flow measurements) used at the Environmental and Biotechnology Centre (UBZ) / Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research (UFZ). [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/ufz-weather-station)
- **soil-sensors-on-campbell-loggers** CR Basic program to collect data from EC5 soil sensors on a CR800 data logger. [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/soil-sensors-on-campbell-loggers)
- **LogShit** A collection of scripts for the CR1000 family of Campbell Scientific data loggers with full weather stations and soil sensor networks. [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/LogShit)
- **TORPEDOpH** Scripts to read data from the ATLAS Scientific Environmental monitoring kit using an Arduino. The kit reads water quality data including temperature, pH, EC, dissolved solids, and redox potential. [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/TORPEDOpH)
- **ArduFlow** Scripts to read data from tipping bucket flow meter using an Arduino. [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/ArduFlow)
- **access-log** A Raspberry Pi based access control kiosk we use for logging access and maintainance activites for one of our research infrastructures. The scripts serve a self-contained GUI to a touchscreen kiosk with keyboard and RFID reader for user input and identification using a Flask App and Python. Data is stored in a SQL database and can be exported by email or USB. [Find it on GitHub here.](https://github.com/jknappe/access-log)


# R packages

Bundling useful functions into a separate package for R is super easy. Documenting and testing takes a bit more stamina, though. You can find all of the packages below on GitHub and help me making them better if you like.

## hydrus2r

![hydrus2r]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/hydrus2r/hydrus2r-hex-sticker.png "hydrus2r"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

Import HYDRUS 2D/3D simulation results into R using functions made available in this R package. Find more information on how to install and use the package on it's [GitHub page](https://www.janknappe.com/hydrus2r/).

## quantitray

![quantitray]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects/quantitray/quantitray-hex-sticker.png "quantitray"){:style="float: top;margin-right: 10px;height: 150px;"}

An R package to calculate MPN (most probable number) from IDEXX Quanti-Tray, Quanti-Tray/2000, and Quanti-Tray/Legiolert tests. Find more information on how to install and use the package on it's [GitHub page](https://www.janknappe.com/quantitray/).

# Websites

I did build a few websites just like this one for some community-based projects I am or was involved in. All are hosted there on GitHub built using Jekyll.

- [**preciousplasticdublin.org**](https://www.preciousplasticdublin.org/) Precious Plastic Dublin is a volunteer collective working on practical solutions to plastic waste and pollution in Dublin, Ireland. 
- [**kunststofferei.de**](https://www.kunststofferei.de/en/kunststofferei) Kunststofferei is an open collective working on practical solutions to divert plastic from nature, incinerators and landfills by closing the plastic recycling loop locally. They are based in in Leipzig, Germany
- [**zerowastefestival.ie**](https://www.zerowastefestival.ie/) Zero Waste Festival Ireland is a community-run initiative to facilitate zero waste networking, learning, and sharing in Ireland through a series on pop-up festivals including workshops, talks, screenings, and meet-up sessions at various locations.
