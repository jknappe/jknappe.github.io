I am Jan - a travelling shit-stirrer (in the truest sense of the word) with an undeniable fascination for data, sanitation, and fun facts. This website will keep you updated on my latest ramblings about the science, coding, and some travelling I do.

Feel free to drop me an [email](mailto:jan.knappe@tcd.ie) or [tweet at me](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?via=JanKnappe) any time.
